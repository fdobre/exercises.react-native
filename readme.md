# React Navigation Exercises

To be built. General concept:

- We provide an existing application with a minimal set of incomplete features.
- We provide 3 categories of exercises
  - UI component focus
  - State management focus
  - Performance focus
- Each category will be represented by 3 tabs in a bottom tab bar navigator, so that they are isolated and so we can choose appropriate exercises based on the candidate.
- In each category, the list of exercises increases in difficulty.
- Candidates will fork the repo in their own personal GitHub, and then return their finished exercises as a pull request.
